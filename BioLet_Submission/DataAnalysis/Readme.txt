All data used for analysis is contained in 'completedata.csv'. This file consists of 3 columns. The first 'x' is the natural log transformed value of the inoculum density. The second, 'y', is the binary score of population establishment (1- established; 0- failed to establish). The last column, 'treat', identifies the environmental treatment (1- high carbon, 2- low carbon, 3- low carbon with predation). 

The code associated with the manuscript analysis is contained in `DataAnalysis.Râ€™. This file contains the maximum likelihood analysis and produces the plots in the main text and supplement.
